Thank you for using the R.A.T.S software. Please follow the instructions on how to use it.


To run this Arduino sketch two things are required, the Arduino IDE, and the NewPing.h


Here is the IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
The library: https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-new-ping/downloads

Once downloaded and installed the IDE to your C:\ drive, download the library and copy it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries.

That is all that is needed to run the program.

Open the "main" sketch which contains all classes and methods needed for a succesful compilation of code.
